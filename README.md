<p> This page is dedicated to regional and international <strong> Michigan’s Eastern Upper Penninsula</strong> and our Canadien neighbor events.  It is a project I began when I realized a few minutes of air time every Sunday morning on the iconic Bill Thorne’s Hymn Time could not possibly cover everything that is going on throughout the upcoming week.  I also have the intentions of utilizing and strengthening my creative skills (i.e. Photoshop) to present visual stimulation to my online readers.</p>

<p> If anyone is interested in listening to the current world record holder for the longest tenure on air with the second world record of the longest show on air, then please feel free to tune into WSOO 1230AM at <strong> 10AM </strong> Sunday mornings. </P>
